## Chaos
### A companion app for Arkham Horror: The Card Game


This app streamlines the most cumbersome aspect of *Arkham Horror: The Card Game*, the **chaos bag**. Now players can simply select a scenario, difficulty, and one or more investigators, and they're ready to play. Chaos also logs all of your results for each scenario, viewable as text or histogram.
